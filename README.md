# Air project
This is a ***school project*** from May 2022, I decided to upload it because even though at the time I wrote very bad code, it might be helpful to someone.

## How does it work?
It consists of a JavaFX desktop client that can fetch CO2 pollution and temperature data from an Arduino. The JavaFX desktop client is in the `/AIR-Project` folder, the Arduino firmware is in the `/firmware` folder.

The Arduino displays the data via a 16x2 LCD display, so the JavaFX desktop client does not really add that much functionality except for showing the data via a graph. I wasn't proficient at all with databases and APIs, but some cool stuff could be done with data visualization/collection here. I tried adding notifications when the CO2 level would be too high so that the user could open the doors/windows to let some fresh air in, but I couldn't complete the feature in time for the deadline.
